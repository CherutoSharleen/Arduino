# ARDUINO BASED PROJECTS

This repository contains code from simple codes from my Embedded Systems Class as I try to learn and practice Arduino. It is mainly in Sketch and C. It has basic projects eg.
- Lighting an LED using a Push Button
- Potentiometer
- LED Screen
- KeyPad
- LED Light controlled using Light Sensor 

The projects were implemented using [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard?type=circuits&collection=designs)
